## Protocol for LB medium and LB agar plates
*Written by Katariina Jaenes*

### INTRODUCTION

In order for bacteria to be successfully cultured, they must be grown in the appropriate media. LB, also
known as Lysogeny broth, is a nutrient rich broth that is a standard for culturing Escherichia coli, as it
allows for quick growth and high yields. Therefore the proper preparation of LB will be crucial to
maintaining our bacterial stock throughout the summer. Furthermore, addition of agar to LB broth
creates a gel for bacteria to grow upon, and is therefore used for plating bacterial cultures on petri
dishes.
We will be preparing our own LB as well as our own LB agar plates, which will be used to culture
E.coli K-12.

### BASIC TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS

Agar vs. Agarose: Agar is used for making petri plates to culture organisms, while agarose is used for
making gels, in the likes of SDS-PAGE and gel electrophoresis

### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

**SDS (safety data sheet)**: Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be
prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.

**PPE (Personal protective equipment)**: Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This
means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact
lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times,
and long hair should be tied back.

**Autoclave**: The autoclave should only be handled by execs. **Note that any autoclaved materials
may still be hot and should therefore be handled with caution. Be careful not to burn yourself.**

### MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT

Note: this recipe is for 500ml of LB, which makes approximately 18 plates. LB can be kept for 3-4
months

### Reagents

* 5g NaCl
* 5g Tryptone
* 2.5g Yeast extract
* 7.5g of agar **This is only necessary if you are making LB agar plates**
* 500ml of dH20 (distilled water)

### Materials

* 1L pyrex bottle
* 1L graduated cylinder
* Filter paper and scupula
* Stack of sterile plates (this protocol makes approx 25.)
* Bunsen Burner/Ethanol burner
* 70% EtOH wash bottle
* paper towels/wipes

### LAB PROTOCOL

**Part 1. Making the LB broth**

*This step can be carried out at a regular lab bench.*

1. Obtain a clean 1L pyrex bottle
2. Obtain a graduated cylinder with 500ml of dH20 (distilled water) and add to the bottle. Record the
amount added.
3. Using filter paper, separately measure out 5g of NaCl, 5 g of Tryptone, and 2.5g of yeast extract on a
scale and add them to the bottle. Swirl the bottle in a circular motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate
your scales in between measurements.
4. If you are making LB agar plates, weigh and add 7.5g of agar and swirl to mix. Record the
amount added. Note that the contents do not necessarily need to be completely in solution before
autoclaving.

**Part 2. Autoclaving ***ONLY DONE BY EXECS*****

1. Lightly seal the top of the beaker with aluminium foil, and label the beaker with autoclave tape.
Include LB (agar) – your name – date - iGEM.
**Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following
steps 2 - 5.**
2. Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the LB bottle into the autoclave room. Remember
to store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
4. Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for
approximately 20mins.
5. **The contents of the beaker will be hot after autoclaving, therefore take necessary measures
to prevent burns.** After autoclaving, allow the LB media too cool to 55oC before handling.
6. The LB broth can be stored in sterile conditions at room temperature, and should be good for a 3-4
months. Flame the lip of the bottle each time the LB is used. If the LB is contaminated it will appear cloudy. If the LB contains antibiotics: store in a
-4C freezer - (However it is not recommended to store LB with antibiotics as the antibiotic will degrade over time)

**Part 3. Pouring the plates (if you are making LB agar)**

** While pouring the plates it is crucial to maintain a sterile environment. This should be done in
room WB303, with a sterile environment provided by a lit bunsen burner.**

*Note: While you are waiting for the autoclave, steps 1- 3 can be done in the meantime, in addition to
the clean up from Part 1.*

1. Sterilize the workspace with 70% EtOH before depositing your materials. Light the bunsen burner.
2. Obtain a stack/roll of empty plates. The plates should still be in their plastic sleeve/wrapping, as they
should be sterile. Don't throw out the wrapping as it can be used to store the plates. It is essential that
you minimize any chance of contaminating the plates. Make sure that you open the package at the
top, and expose the plates as minimally as possible. Note that this protocol makes approximately 25
plates.
3. Once you take the plates out, store them upside down on your lab bench. Label the plates with your
name – iGEM 2015 – date prepared – designated stripe* (if are using antibiotic). Once labelled, you
may stack the plates to free up workspace.
4. Allow the LB media to cool before pouring. The LB will start to settle at about 30oC.
5. If you are preparing selective media, add antibiotic to the mixture. Use the recommended antibiotic
concentrations (see table below) Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix. If you don't know
whether or not you are preparing selective media, ask.

|      Antibiotic       | Recommended Concentration |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Chloramphenicol (CAM) |          25ug/mL          |
|   Ampicillin (AMP)    |         100ug/mL          |



*One stripe along the sides corresponds to CAM, two stripes corresponds to AMP*

6. Take an empty plate and open it slightly. You do not need to open it all the way to pour the agar.
When pouring the agar, pour until 2/3 of the plate has been covered, or approximately half of the
plate has been filled when viewed from the side. Pour the agar slowly, to prevent the formation of
bubbles. Swirl the plate in a circular motion to distribute the media evenly on the plate.
8. After pouring, set the plates to cool in stacks of 4-5, as this takes up less space. Don't stack the plates
too high – we want to prevent spills.
9. Rinse the pyrex bottle with water before the remnants solidify and become hard to remove.
10. Allow the plates to cool for at least 20 minutes until the agar has solidified. Flip the plates to
prevent condensation forming on the agar. The plates can then be stacked and stored in plastic bags
(ideally re-use the plastic bags that the plates come in.)
11. The LB agar plates should be stored in a 4oC freezer, should be good for 1-2 months

### LEAVING THE LAB

Prior to leaving the lab, you should:

1. Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
2. Wipe down your workspace.
3. Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly
stored in the fridge.

## Protocol for SOC medium

*Written by Katariina Jaenes*

### INTRODUCTION

SOC is a variant of the rich media SOB (super optimal broth) with catabolite repression. This means
that glucose is supplemented in the media, allowing for optimal metabolic conditions for the bacteria.
SOC increases the transformation efficiency of cells, as it provides ample nutrients to cells that have
recently undergone stress as result of having been made competent. Accordingly, it will be used in
bacterial transformation to stabilize the cells and to increase transformation yields. Since SOC is high
in nutrients, it is more easily contaminated than LB or King's B media.

### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

**SDS (safety data sheet)**: Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be
prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.

**PPE (Personal protective equipment)**: Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This
means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact
lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times,

### LAB PROTOCOL

**Part 1. Making the SOC broth**

*This step can be carried out at a regular lab bench.*

1. Obtain two 1L mL pyrex bottles. Ensure that the bottles can be sealed with a cap - this will help
prevent contamination and enable long term storage.
2. Obtain a graduated cylinder with 500ml of dH20 (distilled water).
3. Using filter paper, separately measure out 10g tryptone, 2.5g yeast extract, 0.292g NaCl, 0.093g
KCl, _____g MgCl2 anhydrate, 1.234g MgSO4, heptahydrate. on a scale and add them to the 1L bottle.
Add 400mL dH20. Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate your scales in
between measurements.
4. In the separate bottle, and measure out 1.802g glucose on a scale and add the rest of the 100mL
dH20. Recalibrate your scales in between measurements.

**** The 1L autoclaved separately, as the contents will react if autoclaved together. ***

** Part 2.  Autoclaving ONLY DONE BY EXECS**

1. Lightly seal the top of the bottles with aluminium foil, or unscrew the caps. Label both with
autoclave tape. Include a label with SOC – your name – date - iGEM 2015.
**Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following
steps 2 - 5.**
2. Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the bottles into the autoclave room. Remember to
store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
3. Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for
approximately 20mins.
4. **The contents of the bottles will be hot after autoclaving, therefore take necessary measures
to prevent burns. After autoclaving, allow the media too cool to 55oC before handling.**

**Part 3**

*This part should be done in room WB303, in sterile conditions close to a bunsen burner.*

6. In a sterile environment, slowly add the autoclaved 1.802g glucose and dH20 to the beaker
containing the autoclaved _____g MgCl2 and 1.234g MgSO4, 10g tryptone, 2.5g yeast extract, 0.292g
NaCl, 0.093g Kcl and dH20. Flame the lip of the bottle before transferring the contents. Swirl to mix,
and seal tightly to prevent contamination. Flame the cap before sealing.
7. The SOC broth can be stored in sterile conditions at room temperature, and should be good for a 3-4
months. Flame the lip of the bottle each time the SOC is used. SOC should be handled carefully, as it is
especially prone to contamination.

### LEAVING THE LAB

Prior to leaving the lab, you should:

1. Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
2. Wipe down your workspace.
3. Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly
stored in the fridge.

## King's B Protocol

*Written by Katariina Jaenes*
### INTRODUCTION

In order for bacteria to be successfully cultured, they must be grown in the appropriate media. King's B
media, formulated by King et al,. Is a nonselective media that is a standard for culturing Pseudomonas
species, as it allows for quick growth and high yields. Therefore, the proper preparation of King's B
will be crucial to maintaining our bacterial stock throughout the summer. Furthermore, addition of agar
to King's B creates a gel for bacteria to grow upon, and is therefore used for plating bacterial cultures
on petri dishes.
We will be preparing our own King's B as well as our own King's B agar plates, which will be used to
culture Pseudomonas putida F1.

7.5 g glycerol on a scale and add them to the bottle with 500mL dH20. Swirl the beaker in a circular
motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate your scales in between measurements.
4. In a separate flask, add 12g of MgSO4
 and 100mL of dH20. This will be the stock solution of 1M
5. If you are making agar plates, weigh and add 7.5g of agar to the 500mL solution, and swirl to mix.
Record the amount added. Note that the contents do not necessarily need to be completely in solution
before autoclaving.

**Part 2. Autoclaving ***ONLY DONE BY EXECS***
