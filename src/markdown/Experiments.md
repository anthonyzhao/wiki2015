## Protocol for LB medium and LB agar plates
*Written by Katariina Jaenes*

### INTRODUCTION

In order for bacteria to be successfully cultured, they must be grown in the appropriate media. LB, also
known as Lysogeny broth, is a nutrient rich broth that is a standard for culturing Escherichia coli, as it
allows for quick growth and high yields. Therefore the proper preparation of LB will be crucial to
maintaining our bacterial stock throughout the summer. Furthermore, addition of agar to LB broth
creates a gel for bacteria to grow upon, and is therefore used for plating bacterial cultures on petri
dishes.
We will be preparing our own LB as well as our own LB agar plates, which will be used to culture
E.coli K-12.

### BASIC TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS

Agar vs. Agarose: Agar is used for making petri plates to culture organisms, while agarose is used for
making gels, in the likes of SDS-PAGE and gel electrophoresis

### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

**SDS (safety data sheet)**: Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be
prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.

**PPE (Personal protective equipment)**: Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This
means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact
lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times,
and long hair should be tied back.

**Autoclave**: The autoclave should only be handled by execs. **Note that any autoclaved materials
may still be hot and should therefore be handled with caution. Be careful not to burn yourself.**

### MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT

Note: this recipe is for 500ml of LB, which makes approximately 18 plates. LB can be kept for 3-4
months

### Reagents

* 5g NaCl
* 5g Tryptone
* 2.5g Yeast extract
* 7.5g of agar **This is only necessary if you are making LB agar plates**
* 500ml of dH20 (distilled water)

### Materials

* 1L pyrex bottle
* 1L graduated cylinder
* Filter paper and scupula
* Stack of sterile plates (this protocol makes approx 25.)
* Bunsen Burner/Ethanol burner
* 70% EtOH wash bottle
* paper towels/wipes

### LAB PROTOCOL

**Part 1. Making the LB broth**

*This step can be carried out at a regular lab bench.*

1. Obtain a clean 1L pyrex bottle
2. Obtain a graduated cylinder with 500ml of dH20 (distilled water) and add to the bottle. Record the
amount added.
3. Using filter paper, separately measure out 5g of NaCl, 5 g of Tryptone, and 2.5g of yeast extract on a
scale and add them to the bottle. Swirl the bottle in a circular motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate
your scales in between measurements.
4. If you are making LB agar plates, weigh and add 7.5g of agar and swirl to mix. Record the
amount added. Note that the contents do not necessarily need to be completely in solution before
autoclaving.

**Part 2. Autoclaving ***ONLY DONE BY EXECS*****

1. Lightly seal the top of the beaker with aluminium foil, and label the beaker with autoclave tape.
Include LB (agar) – your name – date - iGEM.
**Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following
steps 2 - 5.**
2. Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the LB bottle into the autoclave room. Remember
to store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
4. Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for
approximately 20mins.
5. **The contents of the beaker will be hot after autoclaving, therefore take necessary measures
to prevent burns.** After autoclaving, allow the LB media too cool to 55oC before handling.
6. The LB broth can be stored in sterile conditions at room temperature, and should be good for a 3-4
months. Flame the lip of the bottle each time the LB is used. If the LB is contaminated it will appear cloudy. If the LB contains antibiotics: store in a
-4C freezer - (However it is not recommended to store LB with antibiotics as the antibiotic will degrade over time)

**Part 3. Pouring the plates (if you are making LB agar)**

** While pouring the plates it is crucial to maintain a sterile environment. This should be done in
room WB303, with a sterile environment provided by a lit bunsen burner.**

*Note: While you are waiting for the autoclave, steps 1- 3 can be done in the meantime, in addition to
the clean up from Part 1.*

1. Sterilize the workspace with 70% EtOH before depositing your materials. Light the bunsen burner.
2. Obtain a stack/roll of empty plates. The plates should still be in their plastic sleeve/wrapping, as they
should be sterile. Don't throw out the wrapping as it can be used to store the plates. It is essential that
you minimize any chance of contaminating the plates. Make sure that you open the package at the
top, and expose the plates as minimally as possible. Note that this protocol makes approximately 25
plates.
3. Once you take the plates out, store them upside down on your lab bench. Label the plates with your
name – iGEM 2015 – date prepared – designated stripe* (if are using antibiotic). Once labelled, you
may stack the plates to free up workspace.
4. Allow the LB media to cool before pouring. The LB will start to settle at about 30oC.
5. If you are preparing selective media, add antibiotic to the mixture. Use the recommended antibiotic
concentrations (see table below) Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix. If you don't know
whether or not you are preparing selective media, ask.

|      Antibiotic       | Recommended Concentration |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Chloramphenicol (CAM) |          25ug/mL          |
|   Ampicillin (AMP)    |         100ug/mL          |



*One stripe along the sides corresponds to CAM, two stripes corresponds to AMP*

6. Take an empty plate and open it slightly. You do not need to open it all the way to pour the agar.
When pouring the agar, pour until 2/3 of the plate has been covered, or approximately half of the
plate has been filled when viewed from the side. Pour the agar slowly, to prevent the formation of
bubbles. Swirl the plate in a circular motion to distribute the media evenly on the plate.
8. After pouring, set the plates to cool in stacks of 4-5, as this takes up less space. Don't stack the plates
too high – we want to prevent spills.
9. Rinse the pyrex bottle with water before the remnants solidify and become hard to remove.
10. Allow the plates to cool for at least 20 minutes until the agar has solidified. Flip the plates to
prevent condensation forming on the agar. The plates can then be stacked and stored in plastic bags
(ideally re-use the plastic bags that the plates come in.)
11. The LB agar plates should be stored in a 4oC freezer, should be good for 1-2 months

### LEAVING THE LAB

Prior to leaving the lab, you should:

1. Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
2. Wipe down your workspace.
3. Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly
stored in the fridge.

## Protocol for SOC medium

*Written by Katariina Jaenes*

### INTRODUCTION

SOC is a variant of the rich media SOB (super optimal broth) with catabolite repression. This means
that glucose is supplemented in the media, allowing for optimal metabolic conditions for the bacteria.
SOC increases the transformation efficiency of cells, as it provides ample nutrients to cells that have
recently undergone stress as result of having been made competent. Accordingly, it will be used in
bacterial transformation to stabilize the cells and to increase transformation yields. Since SOC is high
in nutrients, it is more easily contaminated than LB or King's B media.

### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

**SDS (safety data sheet)**: Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be
prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.

**PPE (Personal protective equipment)**: Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This
means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact
lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times,
and long hair should be tied back.

**Autoclave**: The autoclave should only be handled by execs. **Note that any autoclaved materials
may still be hot and should therefore be handled with caution. Be careful not to burn yourself.**

KCl, _____g MgCl2 anhydrate, 1.234g MgSO4, heptahydrate. on a scale and add them to the 1L bottle.
Add 400mL dH20. Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate your scales in
between measurements.
4. In the separate bottle, and measure out 1.802g glucose on a scale and add the rest of the 100mL
dH20. Recalibrate your scales in between measurements.

**** The 1L autoclaved separately, as the contents will react if autoclaved together. ***

** Part 2.  Autoclaving ONLY DONE BY EXECS**

1. Lightly seal the top of the bottles with aluminium foil, or unscrew the caps. Label both with
autoclave tape. Include a label with SOC – your name – date - iGEM 2015.
**Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following
steps 2 - 5.**
2. Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the bottles into the autoclave room. Remember to
store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
3. Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for

# Antibiotic Stock Preparation
_Written by Dr. Tim Lee_

### **Background**

  The preparation of antibiotic stock is a relatively simple series of mixing and dilutions. The
antibiotic stocks are typically made from four antibiotics : Ampicillin, Kanamycin, Tetracycline
and Chloramphenicol. With the exception of chloramphenicol, the other antibiotics are light
sensitive and once stock is prepared they are wrapped in foil to reduce light exposure.

  An antibiotic comes in a powder form as the basic stock and is mixed with milli-Q water
to form a stock solution. Antibiotic stock preparation follows the same basic process for each
antibiotic, varying only in concentration which is dependent on the type of antibiotic used.

  Antibiotic stocks are prepared for use either in liquid or solid media. In the case of liquid
media, the antibiotic stock is simply added and mixed in. For solid media, usually agar and LB, the
media is sent for autoclaving, and while the media is still hot the antibiotic is added and mixed.
This is to ensure that the antibiotic can be mixed evenly amongst the media before it solidifies into
a solid state.

Antibiotics are used for the purpose of selection. In terms of synthetic biology, plasmids
confer selective antibiotic resistance when successfully transformed into their target bacteria.
Using liquid or solid growth media that has been treated with antibiotics provides a selection
control for those bacteria that have successfully incorporated the plasmid.

### **Basic Terminology and Concepts**

There are some terms which will be commonly used to describe the preparation of
antibiotic stocks. Familiarity and understanding of these terms is key to comprehend the protocol.

**Milli-Q**- Water that has been purified through successive steps of filtration and
deionization. The standard used in our lab is typically 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C, measured in
resistance due to the lack of ions. The filters used are 0.22 μm in size to ensure a high
level of purity. This water is used for preparing our antibacterial stock to ensure purity.

**LB** – Lysogeny Broth, is a very standard and simple media to create due to its recipe
consisting of 3 components - tryptone, yeast extract, and sodium chloride. This mix of
anhydrous ingredients is added to water and then autoclaved, producing liquid media. The
production of solid LB for plates is done by adding agar, a protein isolated from certain
species of seaweed which coagulates the liquid into a gel like form when cooled. This is
done prior to autoclaving and is poured into the plates while still hot, where it will cool
into the plate shape.

**Aliquot** - An aliquot is a term to denote a certain quantity of something. In this case an
aliquot of antibiotic stock would denote either 1mL or 0.5mL, depending on the antibiotic.

**Antibiotic**- Compounds which inhibit bacterial growth. They act either bacteriostatically
by preventing reproduction of the bacteria, or bacteriocidally where they directly kill the
bacteria. Generally bacteriocides work by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan in
the bacteria's cell walls. Tetracycline is an example of a bacteriostatic, where it acts by
binding to the ribosomes of prokaryotic bacteria and inhibits translation.

**Autoclave**- A piece of equipment used for sterilization. The autoclave performs much like
a pressure cooker: it subjects the contents inside it to a high temperature and high pressure
steam bath. Usually the temperature is 121 Celsius and at 15lbs/in2
20 minutes is enough to kill most microorganisms and render equipment sterile. When
adding antibiotics to media, it is done after autoclaving so that the heat does not destroy
the antibiotic activity.

### Safety Precautions

- When pouring liquid, commit to the pour to prevent spills.
- Use proper PPE

_Written by Seray Cicek_

### Part 1: Casting the gel
1. Add 0.5g of Agarose and 50ml of 1X TAE buffer to an Erlenmeyer flask. (Note that TAE
buffer in the stock has 50X concentration and needs to be diluted with autoclaved Milli-Q
water)
1. Place the flask into the microwave. **After this step flask will be hot. Use heat
gloves**
1. Set the timer to 2 min. Start the microwave oven but stop every 30 sec to swirl the
contents of the flask. This helps suspend the undissolved agarose. Continue until agarose
particles are dissolved.
1. While hot, add 3ul of 10,000x SYBR Safe into the agarose solution
and mix throughly.
- Set the flask aside for cooling. Occasionally swirl to make the cooling even.
- Set up the gel tray and make sure that there is no leak by testing it with dH20 and kimwipes.
- When the flask is cool enough for you to handle easily, pour the solution into the tray.
- Wait until the gel solidifies.

### Part 2: Loading the gel
1. Make a note of what is going into each well and put that in your lab notebook.
- Determine the DNA concentrations via Nanodrop. (Approximately 100ng DNA per band
is required.)
- Cut a piece of parafilm to use as a mixing surface. Alternatively can use PCR tubes.
- Mix DNA with loading dye in a 1:1 ratio directly on the parafilm or in the PCR tubes using a pipette tip and gently aspirating. (i.e. 10uL of DNA with 2uL of 6x loading buffer) Mix by pipetting up and down. Avoid bubbles.
- Carefully remove the comb of the gel.
- Place the gel into the gel electrophoresis apparatus with its tray.
- Add more 1X TAE buffer to cover the gel completely. Buffer should be 1-2mm above
the gel. Make sure that all the wells are submerged.
1. Load 10uL of DNA ladder to the first well. Add 10uL of your sample DNA
to corresponding wells. (Remember record which wells you load)
1. Put the lid on. The negative (-/black) electrode should be closer to the DNA wells as DNA
migrates towards the positive (+/red) electrode.
10.Set the rig to 100V & 60 min. Hit start.
11.Make sure that your DNA does not run off the gel. The loading buffer enables you to track
the DNA.
12.The gel apparatus will stop on its own when the time is up. Proceed to imaging the gel. It can sit in the rig overnight if need be.

## Making Chemically Competent Cells
*Protocol obtained from openwetware:* <http://openwetware.org/wiki/Preparing_chemically_competent_cells>

### Materials
- Plate of cells to be made competent
- TSS buffer
- LB media
- Ice

### Glassware & Equipment
- Falcon tubes
- 500μl Eppendorf tubes, on ice
- 200ml conical flask
- 200μl pipetman or repeating pipettor
- 5ml pipette

### Protocol
**Part 1: TSS Buffer**

To make 50 mL:

* 5g PEG 8000
* 1.5 mL 1M MgCl2 (or 0.30g MgCl2*6H20)
* 2.5 mL DMSO
* Add LB to 50 mL
* Filter sterilize (0.22 μm filter)

**Part 2: Making Chemically Competent Cells**

1. Grow a 5ml overnight culture of cells in LB media. In the morning, dilute this culture
back into 25-50ml of fresh LB media in a 200ml conical flask. You should aim to dilute
the overnight culture by at least 1/100.
1. Grow the diluted culture to an OD600 of 0.2 - 0.5. (You will get a very small pellet if you
grow 25ml to OD600 0.2)
1. Put eppendorf tubes on ice now so that they are cold when cells are aliquoted into them
later. If your culture is X ml, you will need X tubes. At this point you should also make
sure that your TSS is being chilled (it should be stored at 4
fresh then put it in an ice bath).
1. Split the culture into two 50ml falcon tubes and incubate on ice for 10 min.
All subsequent steps should be carried out at 4
wherever possible
- Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm and 4
- Remove supernatant. The cell pellets should be sufficiently solid that you can just pour
off the supernatant if you are careful. Pipette out any remaining media.
1. Resuspend in chilled TSS buffer. The volume of TSS to use is 10% of the culture volume
that you spun down. You may need to vortex gently to fully resuspend the culture, keep
an eye out for small cell aggregates even after the pellet is completely off the wall.
1. Add 100 μl aliquots to your chilled eppendorfs and store at − 80oC.

  o Freeze the cells immediately using a dry ice bath.

  o If you run a control every time you clone (i.e. a vector-only ligation), you can as
  you can as
  well freeze cells in 200 μl aliquots. Unused cells can be frozen back once and
  reused, albeit with some loss of competence.

## Lab protocol for bacterial transformation
_Written by Matt D'Iorio_

### Introduction
In this protocol, you will be using chemically competent E coli that have been
placed in a calcium chloride solution prior to freezing. The solution acts to
neutralize the cells so that they don't repel each other. The bacteria and plasmid
mixture will be chilled on an ice for 30 minutes. Placing the mixture in a 42
degrees Celsius water bath for 30 seconds will heat shock the mixture, which will
cause the transformation. Once the LB is added and mixed with the transformed
bacteria, it can be plated on the LB plate with an antibiotic. Since a lot of the
bacteria will not be transformed after the heat shock, plating E. coli with an
antibiotic will ensure only the transformed E. coli survive.
Separate reagents from materials

### Basic Terminology and concepts
**Transformation** – The process in which the genetic makeup of a cell is changed
by introduction of DNA from the surrounding environment.

**Competent E. coli** – E. coli in a state where it can allow the uptake of DNA

**Heat Shock** – A sudden increase in temperature used to propel a plasmid into a
bacterium

### Safety precautions
This is a benign lab protocol, but don't forget that PPE is necessary at all times.
The E. coli you will be working with will be non-pathogenic but it should still be
handled properly, which means it should not come into contact with your skin or
gloves. If you are removing materials from the -80 degrees Celsius freezer, do not
use your bare hands or regular lab gloves, use gloves designated specifically for
the freezer.

### Reagents
- Competent E. coli cells
- 250 μL of SOC
- LB plate supplemented with antibiotics
- Materials and equipment
- Set of micropipettes and pipette tips
- 5 x1.5mL – microcentrifuge tube
- Ice bath
- Thermomixer
- Streaker/Glass beads

### Lab protocol
1. Thaw competent E. coli on ice
  * Competent cells till be in the -80 degrees Celsius freezer
  * Do NOT thaw cells by hand, if they are warmed by hand they will
no longer be competent
- Mix the cells gently with a pipette tip (do not pipette up and down)
- Aliquot 50μL of bacteria into a pre-chilled 1.5mL-microcentrifuge tube.
- Add 1-2 μL of the plasmid to the bacterial sample, and mix gently with the
pipette tip (don't pipette up and down)
- Incubate the tube on ice for 30 minutes.
- While the bacteria are on ice, ensure the water bath is set to 42°C
- Put 250μL of LB in a microcentrifuge tube and place it in the 37°C
incubator to warm up during this time
1. After the 30 minute incubation period, place the tube in the 42°C water bath
(mixing OFF) for exactly 30 seconds (45 seconds for E.coli DH10 beta)
1. Place the tube on ice for two (2) minutes
10.Add 250μL of pre-warmed SOC
- Shake in 37°C incubator, 300 rpm, for 1-2 hours
- Spread 100μL of the transformed bacteria on an LB plate supplemented
with the appropriate antibiotic
1. Label plate with name, date, and what it is (iGEM 2015 – Transformed E.
Coli – Your Name)
- Allow the plates to dry inverted, then place in the 37°C incubator O/N

### Leaving the lab
- Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a
designated individual.
- Wipe down your workspace.
- Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates
have been properly stored in the fridge.
- Dispose of all disposable tubes and pipette tips used in biohazard containers.
- Make sure your plates are labelled and put in a place they can be found.
