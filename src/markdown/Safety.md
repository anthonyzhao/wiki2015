# Safety issues and proposed solutions

### Synthetic bacterias safety concerns:
The major safety concern in use of synthetic biology is it's exposure to the natural environment, where synthetic organisms could impact the the ecosystem in unpredictable and unidentified ways. For the purpose of our reasearch, our goal is to devalop synthetic bacteria that can effectibely degrade Toluene in the tailings water. However, synthetic bacteria can not be directly injected into the natural ecosystem due to following reasons:
* Synthetic bacteria can disrupt the food chains and food webs in natural ecosystem
* Synthetic bacteria could be beneficial, at the same time could be lethal to other species living in the same community
* Mutations in synthtic bacteria can be lethal and irrevesible
* Synthtic bacteria would compete with pre-existing species, which can potentially lead to extinction of native species

### Propositions for addressingsafety concerns







## Safety in iGEM

Please visit [the main Safety page](http://2015.igem.org/Safety) to find this
year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible
research in iGEM.

On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any
safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can **go beyond the
questions on the safety forms**, and write about whatever safety topics are most
interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto
this wiki page.)

#### Safe Project Design

Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions
about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:

* Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
* Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
* Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
* Including an "induced lethality" or "kill-switch" device

#### Safe Lab Work

What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any
unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!

#### Safe Shipment

Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How
did you solve those problems?
