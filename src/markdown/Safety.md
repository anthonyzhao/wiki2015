# Safety issues and proposed solutions

### Synthetic bacterias safety concerns:
The major safety concern in use of synthetic biology is it's exposure to the natural environment, where synthetic organisms could impact the the ecosystem in unpredictable and unidentified ways. For the purpose of our reasearch, our goal is to devalop synthetic bacteria that can effectibely degrade Toluene in the tailings water. However, synthetic bacteria can not be directly injected into the natural ecosystem due to following reasons:
* Synthetic bacteria can disrupt the food chains and food webs in natural ecosystem
* Synthetic bacteria could be beneficial, at the same time could be lethal to other species living in the same community
* Mutations in synthtic bacteria can be lethal and irrevesible
* Synthtic bacteria would compete with pre-existing species, which can potentially lead to extinction of native species

### Propositions for addressingsafety concerns
* We have devaloped a software - __Community Flux Balance Analysis__ - to model different metabolic pathways and interspecies interactions within a community. This would allow us to predict the symbiotic relationships between different species present in the community.
* We have designed a membrane bioreactor which confines bacteria into certain chamber while affectively degrading Toluene. The primary purpose of this bioreactor is to keep synthtic bacteria entirely sparate from the environment. This would allow us to use our bacteria effectively to degrade Toluene and not worry about the environmental threats it may pose. However, in order to apply our software we have to mimic the natural environment in each compartment of the bioreactor. This can be easily achieved by allowing naturally occuring bacteria to exist in each compartment.

An extra membrane will be installed at the exit of the bioreactor, to make sure no bacteria escapes                                   |

If ever there is an overflow of water, the shut off valves will prevent any water from escaping the bioreactor                                       |
| Safety issues associated with cleaning of the bioreactor after prolonged periods of time | For the maintenance of the bioreactor, each shelf can be maintained separately while keeping the rest of the shelves working. For this reason, bioreactor does not need to be shut off for maintenance. Hence, bacteria and other compounds can be safely discarded without disrupting the flow of water |
