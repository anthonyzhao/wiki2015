## TodE and TodF Plasmid Design

Pseudomonas Putida F1 species degrade toluene with the help of tod operon. Toluene dioxygenase and toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydroxygenase transcribed from transcribed from todC1C2BA and todD genes respectively facilitate break down of toluene to 3-methylcatechol. Gerben J. Zylstra et al successfully constructed the plasmid pTDG602 containing todC1C2BAD genes. To achieve complete degradation of toluene down to carbon dioxide and water, we focused on designing a plasmid containing todE and todF genes. After cotransformation of DH10B cells with pTDG602 and our plasmid, E.Coli theoretically should contain all the genes required to achieve complete degradation.

In order to achieve the best protein production efficiency, we codon optimized our todE and todF sequences. We used Salis RBS calculator to optimize translation efficiency. We used a tunable promoter to determine optimum transcription for DH10B cells.

We also used BioBricks in the registry to design plasmids with different efficiency by using RDP kit as shown below.

#### Note

In order to be considered for the [Best New Composite Part
award](http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#SpecialPrizes), you must fill out
this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Composite parts you
have made. Please see the Registry's [Help:Parts
page](http://parts.igem.org/Help:Parts#Basic_and_Composite_Parts) for more
information on part types.

A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic
parts assembled together.
[BBa_I13507](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_I13507) is an example
of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red
fluorescent protein, and a terminator.

New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts
(like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators,
Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).
